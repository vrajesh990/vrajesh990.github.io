## Projects
### [Project 1: UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF GROCERY PURCHASE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND DEPRIVATION](https://github.com/vrajesh990/Tesco)
* Successfully developed predictive models for Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rank and childhood obesity prevalence using advanced machine learning techniques.
* Demonstrated exceptional proficiency in feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
* Skillfully applied feature selection methods to identify the most relevant factors influencing IMD rank and childhood obesity, enhancing model accuracy and interpretability.
* Employed rigorous statistical cross-validation techniques to validate model performance, ensuring reliable and generalizable results.
* Utilized hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune machine learning models, optimizing their predictive power and minimizing overfitting.
* Effectively integrated machine learning and statistical analysis to uncover complex relationships between grocery purchase patterns, socio-economic factors, childhood obesity, and deprivation.

### [Project 2 : Tumour-Classification---knn-classifier](https://github.com/vrajesh990/Tumour-Classification---knn-classifier)
* Develop a robust machine-learning model capable of classifying tumors as benign or malignant based on relevant features.
* Improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tumor classification compared to traditional diagnostic methods.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
* Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Employ techniques for handling class imbalance, if necessary.
* Fine-tune the model to optimize its performance.

### [Project 3 : Pizza Restaurant Sales Analysis and Optimization](https://github.com/vrajesh990/pizza-restaurant-sales/blob/main/pizza%20sales.ipynb)
* Conducted a comprehensive data analysis project for Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired restaurant in New Jersey.
* Utilized transactional data spanning a year to provide actionable insights and optimize operations.
* Answered critical business questions related to busiest days and times, pizza sales, average order value, and seating capacity utilization.
* Employed data visualization techniques, including heatmaps and bar charts, to present findings effectively.
* Identified peak periods for pizza production, aiding in resource allocation during busy hours.
* Determined the best and worst-selling pizzas and provided recommendations for menu adjustments.
* Calculated and improved the average order value, contributing to increased revenue.
* Evaluated seat occupancy rates to optimize seating arrangements and enhance the customer experience.
* Demonstrated expertise in data analysis and visualization to support data-driven decision-making.
