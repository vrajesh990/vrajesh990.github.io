### [Project 2 : Tumour-Classification---knn-classifier](https://github.com/vrajesh990/Tumour-Classification---knn-classifier)
* Develop a robust machine-learning model capable of classifying tumors as benign or malignant based on relevant features.
* Improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tumor classification compared to traditional diagnostic methods.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
* Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Employ techniques for handling class imbalance, if necessary.
* Fine-tune the model to optimize its performance.
